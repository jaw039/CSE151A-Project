**Note:** If you want to take a look at our code and analysis, check out our notebooks in this repository. You may have to refresh a couple times for them to load properly.

## 1. Introduction üèà

The goal of our project was to develop a machine learning system capable of predicting NFL fantasy football performance based on historical player statistics. This problem was chosen due to its practical applications in fantasy sports, professional team scouting, and the broader challenge of predicting human athletic performance in dynamic environments.

As avid NFL fans who have spent countless hours analyzing player performance and debating draft strategies, we wanted to test whether machine learning could systematize the intuitive player evaluation that dedicated football fans develop. Fantasy football transforms every Sunday into a personal investment in player performance, where statistical analysis meets genuine passion for the game.

A robust, high-performing predictive model in this domain could revolutionize several areas:

**Fantasy Sports Applications:**
- **Automated Draft Strategy:** Our models can identify undervalued players and optimal draft positions, giving fantasy managers a competitive edge
- **Weekly Lineup Optimization:** Predictive models help determine which players to start based on matchup analysis and consistency metrics
- **Trade Evaluation:** Quantitative player valuations enable more informed trade decisions throughout the fantasy season

**Professional Team Applications:**
- **Player Scouting:** Teams can identify undervalued free agents and draft prospects who may outperform their projected draft position
- **Contract Negotiations:** Data-driven performance projections help teams make optimal contract decisions based on predicted future value rather than past achievements
- **Roster Management:** Predictive models assist in determining when to extend, trade, or release players based on projected career trajectories

**Broader Sports Analytics:**
- **Injury Impact Assessment:** Understanding how injuries affect long-term performance patterns
- **Age Curve Analysis:** Quantifying how players of different positions age and when performance typically declines
- **Scheme Fit Evaluation:** Identifying which players are likely to succeed in specific offensive systems

This project was also a natural extension of our shared passion for football and data science, allowing us to combine technical skills with genuine sports knowledge.

params = {
    'C': [1, 10, 50, 100],
    'epsilon': [0.1, 0.5, 1.0],
    'gamma': ['scale', 0.01, 0.1, 1],
    'kernel': ['rbf', 'poly']
}

grid = GridSearchCV(SVR(), params, cv=5, scoring='r2')
grid.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
```
### 3.4a Model 1 Enhancement
- **Position-Specific Filtering:** Focus on fantasy-relevant players (RB1/RB2 only)

- **Comparison across Positions** The Principal Component Analysis gave us a representation of our data allowing us to compare players across all positions from RB, QB, TE, WR, despite the vastly different roles each of these play on the field
- **Evaluation of Z-score to Fantasy Percentile** Taking the Z-score of every player in the PCA graph, and comparing it against their season fantasy scores gives us the following graph:


## 4. Data Exploration and Analysis ÔøΩ

### 4.1 Dataset Overview

<img width="342" height="728" alt="Dataset Observations" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/348b2dee-d488-4ff2-93b1-b71bf5563c89" />

Our dataset is a comprehensive collection of NFL statistics from 1999-2022, comprising **215,243 total observations** distributed across eight CSV files. The data have two primary axes: (weekly vs. yearly) and (player vs. team), which is ideal for our goal of building a fantasy football prediction system.

<img width="868" height="763" alt="Dataset Structure Analysis" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/faeaaba7-ca3b-445e-8d05-0c73fa28ab20" />

**Player-Level Data (Primary Focus):**
- **Weekly Offensive Stats (58,629 observations):** This is the most critical dataset for our project. Each observation represents a single player's offensive performance in one game.
- **Yearly Offensive Stats (7,133 observations):** Aggregated weekly data (16-17 games) into full-season summaries for each player, useful for establishing baseline performance.
- **Defensive Stats (Weekly & Yearly):** While our primary focus is offense, the 117,993 weekly and 16,148 yearly defensive observations provide context for team defensive efficiency.

**Team-Level Data (Contextual):** The team-level files provide broader context on team tendencies (e.g., pass-heavy vs. run-heavy offenses) that can influence a player's opportunity and projected output.

### 4.2 Target Variable Creation

<img width="946" height="332" alt="Variable Analysis" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7dfedeea-2b04-4d59-9168-4ab59cc35ee4" />

For our fantasy football prediction system, we engineered our target variable `fantasy_points_ppr` based on standard PPR (Points Per Reception) league scoring:

- **1 point per reception** ('receptions')
- **0.1 points per rushing/receiving yard** ('rushing_yards', 'receiving_yards')
- **6 points per rushing/receiving touchdown** ('rushing_tds', 'receiving_tds')
- **4 points per passing touchdown** ('passing_tds')
- **-2 points per interception thrown** ('interceptions')

This engineered column serves as a continuous variable on a ratio scale and represents the value our models aim to predict for future player performance.

### 4.3 Data Quality Assessment

<img width="1265" height="808" alt="Missing Values Analysis" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8181a913-540b-4180-848e-2b2a10c1e98b" />

**Missing and Duplicate Values Analysis:**
- **No duplicate rows found** across the primary datasets
- **Missing values identified** in the "yards per carry" column, which we handled by initializing with 0s (indicating no rushing attempts)
- **Data integrity maintained** through systematic filtering and validation processes

## 5. Data Visualization and Key Insights üìä

Our comprehensive visualization approach revealed critical patterns that directly informed our modeling strategy:

### 5.1 Position Distribution Analysis

![Position Distribution Chart](images/position_distribution.png)

**Description:** This pie chart illustrates the distribution of players across different positions within our dataset. From a fantasy drafting perspective, this visualization is key to understanding positional value.

**Key Insights:**
- **Wide Receivers comprise the largest segment** of skill position players
- **Running Backs and Tight Ends represent smaller but crucial position groups**
- Positions with smaller slices (like Running Back or Tight End) demonstrate scarcity, increasing the value of elite players at those positions
- **The drop-off in production** to the next available player is much steeper for scarce positions
- This analysis directly impacts our position-specific modeling approach and draft strategy prioritization

### 5.2 Fantasy Points Consistency Analysis

![Fantasy Points Consistency Chart](images/fantasy_points_consistency.png)

**Description:** This bar chart displays the consistency of fantasy scoring by position, measured by the standard deviation of weekly points. Lower bars signify more consistent, predictable scoring, while higher bars indicate more "boom-or-bust" potential.

**Interpretation:**
- **Lower Bars (More Consistent):** Positions like Quarterback often show lower variance, providing a stable scoring floor each week
- **Higher Bars (Less Consistent):** Positions like Wide Receiver or Tight End have higher variance, meaning their weekly scores fluctuate more
- **Quarterbacks typically show the most consistent scoring patterns**
- **Wide Receivers and Tight Ends exhibit higher variability**

**Fantasy Football Application:** Our models leverage this insight to manage risk by prioritizing players from more consistent positions to build a reliable core, while strategically targeting less consistent, high-upside players for competitive advantage.

### 5.3 Running Back Feature Correlation Analysis

![Multi-Feature Analysis](images/rb_feature_correlation.png)

After focusing on running backs for our initial modeling approach, we analyzed key performance indicators:

**Features Analyzed:**
- **Offensive snap count (opportunity metric)**
- **Rushing yards (volume metric)**  
- **Rushing touchdowns (efficiency metric)**
- **Yards per carry (skill metric)**

**Key Findings:**
- **Strong correlation** between 2023 rushing yards and 2024 fantasy performance
- **Snap count proved crucial** as an opportunity-based predictor
- **Touchdown production showed regression patterns** year-over-year

## 6. Advanced Analytics: Supervised Learning ü§ñ

### 6.1 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Since all fantasy players are scored on the same scale regardless of position, we conducted PCA on 2024 player fantasy data to identify hidden player archetypes and validate our position-based assumptions.

**Methodology:**
1. **Data Filtering:** Focused on 2024 offensive players capable of generating fantasy points
2. **Data Standardization:** Scaled data to mean 0, standard deviation 1 across all players
3. **Aggregation:** Combined player stats across the season for comprehensive analysis
4. **PCA Application:** Applied dimensionality reduction to discover underlying patterns

**Results and Insights:**

![PCA Visualization](images/player_archetypes_pca.png)

**Three Distinct "Branches" Identified:**
- **Far Bottom Right:** Quarterback cluster - sparse and spread out due to smaller QB population
- **Far Left Bottom:** Receiver/TE cluster - dense clustering due to larger population and similar statistical profiles
- **Center to Top:** Running Back cluster - characterized by high rushing yardage and rushing touchdowns

**Principal Component Analysis:**
- **PC1 (Highest Variance):** Dominated by passing yards (positive) vs. receptions (negative)
  - Explains quarterback separation on X-axis
  - Receivers cluster on low end due to reception-heavy profiles
- **PC2:** Rushing yards (positive) vs. passing yards (negative)
  - Traditional QBs (Goff, Burrow) appear bottom due to high passing/low rushing
  - Dual-threat QBs (Daniels, Hurts, Jackson) cluster toward middle

### 6.2 K-Means Clustering Validation

**Objective:** Test whether machine learning could correctly identify player positions based on statistical profiles alone.

**Initial Clustering (K=3):**
- Successfully separated QBs, RBs, and WR/TE groups
- Minor classification issues with low-volume players being grouped as WRs

**Enhanced Clustering (K=4):**
- **100% accuracy** for WR/TE position identification
- **No misclassification** of Running Backs or Quarterbacks
- Successfully isolated backup/low-volume players into distinct cluster

**Validation Results:**
- Machine learning clustering **perfectly aligned** with actual position assignments
- Confirms that statistical profiles inherently separate by position
- Validates our position-specific modeling approach

### 6.3 Player Archetype Identification

Through manual analysis of our PCA results, we identified several distinct player archetypes:

1. **Traditional Pocket Passers:** High passing volume, minimal rushing (Goff, Burrow)
2. **Dual-Threat Quarterbacks:** Balanced passing/rushing production (Jackson, Hurts)
3. **Volume Receivers:** High reception totals, consistent targets
4. **Big-Play Receivers:** Lower volume, higher yards per reception
5. **Workhorse Running Backs:** High carry volume, goal-line opportunities
6. **Pass-Catching Backs:** Significant receiving production alongside rushing

**Fantasy Application:** These archetypes inform draft strategy by identifying player types that provide specific value propositions (floor vs. ceiling, consistency vs. upside potential).

## 7. Model Development and Enhancement üîß

### 7.1 Data Preprocessing Strategy

**Temporal Filtering:**
- Focused on **2023-2024 seasons** for most recent and relevant data
- **Regular season only** filtering (removed playoff data irrelevant to fantasy)
- Position-specific analysis prioritizing fantasy-relevant positions

**Feature Engineering:**
- Created **reliability indices** combining performance and consistency
- Developed **opportunity-based metrics** emphasizing volume indicators
- Implemented **position-specific normalization** for cross-positional comparisons

### 7.2 Model Performance Evolution

**Initial SVR Model:**
```
Train RMSE: 69.92
Test RMSE: 97.70
Train R¬≤: 0.479
Test R¬≤: -0.026
```

**Position-Filtered Enhancement (RB1/RB2 only):**
```
Train RMSE: 71.89
Test RMSE: 74.93
Train R¬≤: 0.457
Test R¬≤: 0.216
```

**Final Tuned Model (GridSearchCV):**
```
Train RMSE: 28.91
Test RMSE: 34.67
Train R¬≤: 0.801
Test R¬≤: 0.739
```

**Key Improvements:**
- **53% reduction** in test RMSE through position filtering
- **Eliminated negative R¬≤** indicating meaningful predictive power
- **GridSearchCV optimization** with parameters: `{'C': 10, 'epsilon': 1.0, 'gamma': 'scale', 'kernel': 'rbf'}`

### 7.3 Model Insights and Limitations

**What Our Model Successfully Captures:**
- **Volume-based opportunity metrics** (snap counts, target share)
- **Touchdown regression patterns** (high scorers typically decline)
- **Position-specific performance patterns** (elite players more predictable)
- **Year-over-year consistency factors** for established players

**Acknowledged Limitations:**
- **Small sample size** (47 RBs with complete data) limits generalizability
- **Missing contextual factors:** coaching changes, injury history, offensive line quality
- **Temporal assumptions:** assumes performance patterns persist across seasons
- **Position isolation:** doesn't account for cross-positional impacts

**Real-World Challenges:**
- NFL's inherent unpredictability due to injuries, weather, game script
- Fantasy football's dynamic environment with weekly adjustments needed
- Equal treatment of statistics that vary significantly in value (red zone vs. garbage time production)

## 8. Conclusions and Future Improvements üéØ

### 8.1 Key Learnings

Our analysis revealed that **statistical modeling for individual positions in isolation is challenging** due to:
- **Fluid nature of NFL rosters** and player roles

- **Weight snap counts more heavily** as indicator of health and role security
- **Incorporate injury probability models** based on historical data
- **Add coaching stability metrics** to account for scheme changes

**Advanced Feature Engineering:**
- **Depth chart movement multipliers** for players changing roles
- **Opponent-adjusted statistics** accounting for defensive strength
- **Game script factors** distinguishing garbage time from meaningful production
- **Red zone opportunity weighting** for touchdown-dependent metrics

**Multi-Position Integration:**
- **Cross-positional correlation analysis** (QB-WR connections, RB-OL dependencies)
- **Team-based modeling** incorporating offensive system effects
- **Weekly prediction capabilities** for in-season adjustments

## 5. Discussion üó£Ô∏è

### 5.1 Model Strengths
Our SVR approach successfully captured several key football analytics concepts:
- **Opportunity Metrics:** Snap count proved crucial for predicting future success
- **Touchdown Regression:** Model identified the well-known phenomenon where high touchdown scorers typically decline
- **Position-Specific Patterns:** Elite players (RB1/RB2) showed more predictable patterns than fringe roster players

### 5.2 Critical Analysis and Limitations
**Sample Size Constraints:** Only 47 running backs had complete 2023-2024 data, limiting generalizability

**Missing Contextual Factors:**
- Coaching changes and scheme alterations
- Injury history and recovery patterns  
- Team offensive line quality and blocking efficiency
- Game script and situational factors

**Temporal Assumptions:** The model assumes 2023 performance patterns persist into 2024, potentially missing regime changes or player development arcs

### 5.3 Real-World Application Challenges
Fantasy football operates in a dynamic environment where player values fluctuate based on weekly performance, injuries, and matchups. Our annual prediction model doesn't capture in-season adjustments that fantasy managers must make throughout the season.

### 5.4 Football Knowledge vs. Data Science
Our project tested whether machine learning could systematize intuitive player evaluation. Results suggest partial success - the model captures broad patterns while missing nuanced factors that experienced fantasy players consider.

**Where Models Excel:**
- Removing emotional bias from player evaluation
- Quantifying touchdown regression and efficiency mean reversion
- Identifying volume-based opportunity metrics

**Where Human Knowledge Remains Superior:**
- Contextualizing coaching changes and scheme fits
- Evaluating injury impact and recovery timelines
- Understanding team dynamics and locker room situations

## 6. Conclusion üèÅ

Our NFL fantasy football prediction project represents a successful integration of sports analytics, machine learning, and genuine football passion. While we initially aimed to build a complete "fantasy football autodrafter," we discovered something more valuable: a framework for enhancing rather than replacing football knowledge.

### Key Achievements
- **Technical Success:** Developed position-specific models with meaningful accuracy (Test R¬≤ = 0.739 for filtered data)
- **Methodological Innovation:** Created reliability indices balancing performance and consistency
- **Sports Analytics Validation:** Successfully identified and quantified known football phenomena

### Future Improvements
- **Enhanced Features:** Incorporate advanced metrics like target share, red zone opportunities, and strength of schedule
- **Dynamic Models:** Develop weekly prediction capabilities for in-season adjustments
- **Multi-Position Analysis:** Extend methodology to quarterbacks, wide receivers, and tight ends
- **Ensemble Methods:** Combine multiple model types for improved accuracy

### Broader Impact
Our methodologies extend beyond fantasy football into professional team management, player development, and contract negotiations. The challenges we encountered - handling seasonal variance, balancing evaluation criteria, and predicting human performance - have applications in financial forecasting, employee evaluation, and healthcare outcomes.
